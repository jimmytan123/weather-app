## Overview

The weather app allows you to search for a city or click Show My Location to get the weather info for your location. The background image is from Unsplash API and it changes according to different cities. This app is built using OOP JavaScript, HTML, Sass, and using the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. The app is based on a tutorial on YouTube only with a basic app feature. I redesigned and added additional features such as modal box, show my location, error handling and also show more weather info for a single location.
